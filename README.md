# Library-Management-System
This is a library management system. It primary goal is to simulate a library-like check out system where the user can checkout, reserve, and return books. While an administrator can control books, deny/approve reservations, and edit users. Finally, there is a faculty role, simulates teachers, this role allows the user to checkout more books.
